Kettle-Cookbook is a auto-documentation tool for [Kettle](http://kettle.pentaho.org), a.k.a. [Pentaho](http://www.pentaho.org) Data Integration.

For a quick and gentle introduction to kettle-cookbook, check out this blog post by Slawomir Chodnicki: [http://type-exit.org/adventures-with-open-source-bi/2010/10/documentation-for-kettle-etl/](http://type-exit.org/adventures-with-open-source-bi/2010/10/documentation-for-kettle-etl/). For a more detailed writeup, including an online demo, check out this blog post by Jan Aertsen from KJube: [http://kjube.blogspot.com/2010/10/kff-cookbook.html](http://kjube.blogspot.com/2010/10/kff-cookbook.html). This also describes how kettle-cookbook is integrated into the [KFF Project](http://kff.kjube.be/), which provides templates and best practices for ETL projects based on Kettle.

Below is a screenshot to provide a quick taste of what documentation generated by kettle-cookbook looks like:
